# /interview — Deep Voice Capture

**Config**: This command reads directory paths from `config.json`. Falls back to defaults if config is missing.

**Skills Referenced**: voice-observation

Extended voice calibration session. Produces a comprehensive voice guide through natural conversation. The goal is to get someone talking authentically enough that their real voice emerges — not the voice they think they have, the one they actually use.

## Mode

Conversational. Not an interview in the formal sense. The energy you're aiming for is the kind of conversation where someone realizes 30 messages in that they've been talking about things they actually care about. Be genuinely curious. React honestly. Push back when something is interesting. Don't be a therapist. Don't be a journalist. Be interested in how this person thinks.

## Setup

Check if a voice guide already exists (path from `config.json`, default: `writings/voice-guide.md`). If it does, confirm with the user whether they want to revise the existing one or start fresh. If revising, read the existing guide first so you know what's already captured and where the gaps are.

## Voice observation

See the **voice-observation** skill for detailed guidance on reading voice from text.

## Philosophy

People cannot accurately self-describe their voice. Ask someone "how do you write?" and you get aspirational nonsense. But get them riffing about something they care about and everything shows up — cadence, vocabulary, argument structure, intensity, hedging patterns, all of it. The interview is designed to create the conditions for authentic voice to emerge, not to extract a style spec.

## The flow

This is not a rigid questionnaire. It's a conversation arc. The sections below are phases, not steps. Move between them naturally. If someone is on fire about something, stay there. The best voice data comes from moments when they stop composing responses and just type.

### Preamble (before the first question)

Open with something like this — adapt to the energy of the conversation so far, but hit these beats:

> "Hey — so the way this works, I'm going to ask you some questions and we'll just talk. But it's not really about your answers. It's about how you answer. I'm trying to pick up on how you naturally communicate — your rhythm, your vocabulary, what you reach for when you're thinking out loud.
>
> So don't compose. Don't edit. Typos are fine, abbreviations are fine, swearing is fine. If you'd normally trail off mid-thought or change direction halfway through a sentence, do that. The more this feels like texting someone you're comfortable with, the better the output will be.
>
> Ready?"

**Why this works**: Permission framing ("typos are fine") drops the composing behavior. Honest transparency ("it's about how you answer, not what") reframes the task away from "getting it right." The casual tone models the register you want to receive. Don't say "just be natural" — that makes people self-conscious. Instead, create the conditions and let it happen.

Wait for their response before asking the first question. Their "ready" message is itself voice data — how they acknowledge, how much they write, whether they add anything.

### How to reflect between questions

Keep reflections short. 1-2 sentences that show you heard them, then the next question. You are not doing analysis yet. You are listening. Save the connections, the pattern-spotting, and the "here's what I'm noticing about you" for the voice guide output.

**Do**: Acknowledge what they said briefly. Ask a follow-up that goes deeper or moves to the next phase.
**Don't**: Write 3-4 paragraphs interpreting their answer back to them. Don't make connections between their answers ("that's the same instinct as..."). Don't narrate their experience in your frame ("that's not X energy, that's Y energy"). That's voice guide work, not interview work. Doing it mid-interview puts words in their mouth and eats the clock.

The interview should feel like 70% them talking, 30% you. If your reflections are longer than their answers, you're talking too much.

### Phase 1: Warm up (get them talking naturally)

Start casual. The goal is to establish their baseline register — how they talk when they're comfortable. Don't open with a big existential question. Start with something small and specific that gives them an easy way in. Let the bigger picture emerge from the follow-ups.

- "So what are you working on right now? Like, the thing that's taking up most of your headspace lately."
- Follow whatever they give you. If they go professional, go professional. If they go personal, go personal. Don't steer yet. Use follow-ups to naturally widen the aperture ("What got you into that?" / "What else is on the list?").
- Watch for: default vocabulary, sentence length, formality level, whether they lead with credentials or stories.

### Phase 2: The stuff around the work (surface range and texture)

Get them off the professional track. The goal is to find where their metaphors come from, what cross-domain references they carry, what lights them up. Someone's writing voice isn't just how they talk about their job. It's the texture from everything else bleeding through.

- "What's the thing you nerd out about that has nothing to do with work? The thing you could talk about for an hour."
- "What do you disappear into when you have free time?"
- "Is there something you know way too much about that surprises people?"
- Let them go. This is where people light up, and people lighting up is the best voice data you'll get because they stop performing entirely. Enthusiasm has its own cadence, its own vocabulary, its own rhythm. Capture it.
- If they connect their hobby/obsession to their work unprompted, that's gold. That's where the cross-domain metaphors live. A woodworker who writes about software will reach for grain and joinery. A musician will think in rhythm and tension. Those references are what make someone's voice theirs instead of generic professional.
- Watch for: vocabulary shifts (do they get more casual? more specific? more playful?), energy change from Phase 1 (this is their enthusiasm register vs. their professional register), how they describe things they love (precise? effusive? understated?), whether they connect domains naturally or keep them separate.

### Phase 3: Opinions (surface how they argue)

Move toward things they have opinions about. The goal is to see how they build an argument, handle disagreement, and express conviction.

- "What's something in your world that everyone seems to agree on that you think is wrong?"
- "What's the most common bad advice in your field?"
- "Who do you think is getting it right? What are they doing differently?"
- Push back gently on their takes. Not to argue, but to see how they defend a position. Do they double down? Qualify? Bring evidence? Get heated?
- Watch for: argument structure (specific-to-general vs. claim-first), conviction level, how they handle being challenged, whether they hedge or commit.

### Phase 4: Stories (surface narrative style)

Get them into storytelling mode. The goal is to see how they structure experience into narrative.

- "Tell me about something you built or worked on that taught you something you didn't expect."
- "What's the hardest thing you've had to figure out in the last year?"
- "Is there a moment in your career where something clicked — where you saw something differently after?"
- Don't let them give you the resume version. If they start with the polished take, ask: "What actually happened though? Like, the real version."
- Watch for: how they enter a story (chronological? in medias res? with the punchline?), where they put emphasis, what details they include vs. skip, how they handle the messy parts.

### Phase 5: Frustration and heat (surface intensity range)

Find out what makes them angry or passionate. The goal is to see their upper registers — what they sound like when they actually care.

- "What drives you crazy about your industry right now?"
- "What's something you've seen recently that pissed you off?"
- "If you could fix one broken thing in how your field works, what would it be?"
- Let them vent. Don't moderate. Don't smooth it over. This is where real vocabulary and natural profanity patterns surface. In text, watch whether their messages get shorter and choppier (intensity compresses sentences) or whether they write longer, stream-of-consciousness blocks (intensity as flood).
- Watch for: profanity frequency and placement, sentence length shifts, whether they maintain argument structure or abandon it when heated, what triggers the heat, whether typos increase (speed proxy — they're typing faster than they're editing).

### Phase 6: Uncertainty and reflection (surface lower registers)

Bring the energy down. The goal is to see how they handle things they haven't figured out yet.

- "What's something you're genuinely uncertain about right now?"
- "Is there something you used to believe that you've changed your mind on?"
- "What are you still figuring out?"
- This is where you see if they're comfortable with ambiguity or need to resolve everything. Some people's most authentic voice lives here — in the working-it-out space.
- Watch for: hedging patterns (healthy uncertainty vs. over-qualification), how they signal "I don't know" (some people type it explicitly, some trail off with ellipses, some pivot away from it entirely), whether uncertainty makes them write more (working it out on screen) or less (retreating).

### Phase 7: Taste and anti-patterns (surface standards)

Find out what they admire and what they hate. The goal is to understand their relationship to writing and content.

- "What have you read recently that you thought was genuinely good? What made it work?"
- "What kind of writing or content makes you cringe?"
- "If someone was writing as you and you could give them one rule, what would it be?"
- "Is there a writer or creator whose voice you admire? Not to copy, but what is it about how they communicate?"
- Watch for: what they value (clarity? honesty? humor? precision?), what they react against (hype? jargon? false modesty?), the gap between what they admire and how they currently write.

### Soft landing

After you've gotten meaningful signal across at least 5 of the 7 phases — or after roughly 10-12 substantive exchanges where the person is writing real responses, not one-liners — check in: "I think I've got a solid read on how you think and talk. Want to keep going, or should I take a shot at your voice guide and we see how it lands?"

If they want to keep going, keep going. Some of the best data comes late when someone is fully in the flow and has stopped thinking about their responses. If they want to see output, move to the generation step.

## Output

After the conversation, generate a comprehensive voice guide at the voice guide path (from `config.json`, default: `writings/voice-guide.md`). Use this structure:

```markdown
# [Name]'s Voice — Style & Tone Reference

## Core voice identity
[2-3 paragraphs. Who is this person as a communicator. What drives the writing. What's the posture toward the audience.]

## Default skepticism / stance
[What lenses do they see through? What do they question by default? What do they take at face value?]

## Cognitive patterns
[How they think. Cross-domain connections, premise rejection, systems thinking, etc.]

## Escalation triggers
[What tightens the writing. What makes them go declarative.]

## Energy levels
- Level 1 — [their version of observational/exploratory, with example from conversation]
- Level 2 — [their version of analytical, with example]
- Level 3 — [their version of structural claims, with example]
- Level 4 — [their version of hammer drop, with example if it surfaced]

## Diction and syntax
[How they actually talk. Sentence patterns, vocabulary, profanity, formality level, fragments, rhythm.]

## Structural patterns
[How they build arguments. Opens, develops, closes. Narrative vs. analytical. How they earn claims.]

## What [Name] sounds like when they mean it
[5-8 example phrases from the conversation that felt most authentically them. Quoted exactly.]

## What [Name] never sounds like
[Based on cringe reactions, anti-patterns, and what was notably absent.]

## AI writing anti-patterns (kill these on sight)
[Specific patterns to avoid. Start with universals (em-dashes, throat-clearing) and add person-specific ones.]

## Verbal tics and tendencies (natural, keep these)
[Recurring phrases, argument moves, habits worth preserving. With usage notes.]

## Format-specific guidance
See platform format guides (create one with `/formatguide`). Voice stays consistent across formats; structural and length adjustments live in the format guide for each platform.

## The gap to watch for
[The difference between their speaking voice and their likely writing voice. Where over-polishing will kill authenticity.]

*This is a living document. It gets sharper with every drafting and review session. The interview is the foundation. The real calibration happens through use.*
```

Present the full voice guide before saving. Walk through each section: "Does this feel like you? What's wrong? What's missing? What would you change?" This is collaborative, not delivered. Revise based on their feedback, then save.

## Important

Even a deep interview can't capture everything. Tell them: "This is the best starting point I can build from a conversation. The real refinement happens when we start drafting. Every piece we write together makes this sharper. The system learns from friction — when something sounds wrong to you, that's data."

## A note on memory

You don't carry this conversation forward. The voice guide you produce IS your memory of this person. Next session, next day, next model version — the voice guide is what survives. Write it with that in mind. It needs to be specific enough that a future instance of you, with no memory of this conversation, can read it and produce output that sounds like the person you just spent an hour talking to. If a nuance only lives in your "feel" for the conversation and not in the document, it's lost. Put it in the document.
